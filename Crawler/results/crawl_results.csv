Let's hear from our budding leaders as they share their stories of this journey so far... Let's hear from our Employees ""Since I joined USEReady 2 years ago, we were introduced to the core values of USEReady, and one of them was continuous improvement. At USEReady, we firmly believe in the power of continuous improvement, which serves as a cornerstone of our organizational culture. Being a part of USEReady, I have also had ample opportunities to upskill myself, whether it's building cloud skills or staying updated with new technologies in the market, such as data mesh technologies like Starburst, and enabling data lake skills in Snowflake."" Kamlesh Kumar Pant Senior Architect ""This was my first Women’s Leadership Program I participated in, and I couldn’t be happier. The guest speaker was such a great teacher. She forced me to dig into my thoughts to not only find challenges I face, but also begin the process of aligning on my passions as a working mother. She showed us the value in small steps, connecting with other women who share the same challenges or passions to work together and push one another to be the best version of ourselves. I also learned to accept that Rome was not built in a day and sometimes there will be fallbacks when working towards personal or professional goals, and that is ok! The most important thing is not to lose your focus and continue the path of your goals. Even if the path you are on takes a few extra turns. I hope this program continues here at USEReady, to empower our women and help them become the best version of themselves."" Liliana Santos Senior HR Business Partner ""Hello, I am Umang Gupta, I joined USEReady in Oct 2022, and since then my journey with the organization has been great. Coming from a non-technical background, initially, I thought I would not fit in this domain easily, but after joining Learning and Development organized a Bootcamp for the new joiners, wherein I got to learn more about the Data Analytics world, got a hands-on experience on tools like Tableau, Alteryx, SQL language which helped me a lot in upskilling myself. I was aligned with a mentor who helped me and guided me throughout my bootcamp journey. I was given a task to prepare 2 capstone projects on Tableau as a part of the bootcamp journey which prepared me for the role I have been assigned."" Umang Gupta Associate BI Analyst ""Over my 5 years at USEReady, there has always been a tremendous focus on making high quality learning and development resources readily available to all. Continuous improvement is one of our key values and it shows. Whether it be the technical bootcamps that allow you to upskill quickly or the soft-skills focused seminars, USEReady has always invested the time and effort into the growth of their employees. What I love the most about our programs is that there is not just an emphasis on content but also on approach and best practices. It allows for a fuller and more well-rounded experience that results in long-term application of the learned skill."" Caitlyn Garger Technical Team Leader"
